# Report

## The Ask

1. Perform exploratory analysis on the dataset.
2. Identify possible data science use cases with the data.
3. Select a use case and prototype a simple model that demonstrates the application of data science to this business.
4. Make two recommendations for the client.

## Submission

You must submit the following via email, in a zipped archive:

1. A 3-4 slide presentation outlining key findings and recommendations for the client.
2. The code you used to perform the analysis.

## Initial considerations

- Number of trips taken.
- Inflows vs outflows (no. trips to vs from = net flow)
- Top bike stations by number of trips taken (however, consider when the bike station was installed - new stations will have fewer routes)
- Top up-and-coming-stations (i.e. they have the highest rate of increase in usage - total_trips/number_days_active)
- Longest routes
- Weekday vs weekend traffic
- Round trip vs point to point
